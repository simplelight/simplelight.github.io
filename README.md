# simplelight.github.io

This is the new official home of Simplelight, a simple, light CSS framework. The original website resided at [https://thimbleprojects.org/lightstuff/493110/](https://thimbleprojects.org/lightstuff/493110/) (broken link), now down after the sunset of Mozilla Thimble. A version imported to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) exists at [https://simplelight.glitch.me/](https://simplelight.glitch.me/). The first migration to GitHub Pages existed at [https://hereiskevin.github.io/simplelight/](https://hereiskevin.github.io/simplelight/) (broken link). Simplelight is going to stay here as it dies a lonely death, slowly being replaced by [minimal.css](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/minimal.css/), which currently powers [https://hornercodingclub.github.io](https://hornercodingclub.github.io).
